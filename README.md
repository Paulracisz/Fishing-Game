# Fishing Web Game
This project is a web-based fishing game that allows users to catch fish, earn coins, and buy better fishing rods to catch better fish. The game is built with React and Vite and features a gallery that displays the user's catch record, including the species, length in centimeters, and the longest fish caught for each species.

## Getting Started
To get started with the game, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies by running npm install.
3. Start the development server by running npm run dev.
4. Open http://127.0.0.1:5173/ in your browser to play the game.
## Gameplay
The game involves capturing a random fish based on the quality of your fishing rod. The better the fishing rod, the higher the chance of catching a rare and valuable fish. The fish species are randomly generated, and the coins earned depend on the species and the length of the fish in centimeters.

Players can spend their earned coins in the shop to purchase better fishing rods, which will increase the chances of catching a better fish. The game also features a gallery where players can view the species of fish they have caught and their catch record, including the longest fish caught for each species.
